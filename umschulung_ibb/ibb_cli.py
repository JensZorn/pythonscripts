#       - CLIs are used by programs where an UI is not required. They were used since
#           the beginning of software development and did not change much since then.
#           UIs made computers useable for every day user, whereas CLIs require certain
#           capabilities in using and understanding the structures of data, scripts and
#           computers
#       - CLI usually start with the name of the executable (e.g. )
#       - they usually use parameters to specify the action that has to take place:
#           - arguments: are required by the command and if not given, the program may
#               run into an error (e.g. 'rm /home/user/test.py' <- '/home/user/text.py' is
#               required by the command 'rm', without it it does not know what to remove)
#           - options: optional parameters which are not required but can help the program
#               to understand what you want (e.g. 'rm -r' <- '-r' is optional, tells the 
#               command 'rm' to recursively remove files within directories (all files))
#           - flags: flags are special option parameters. They are not required and tell
#               tell the program to show certain behaviour (e.g. 'rm --help' <- '--help' 
#               tells the script to show the help for the corresponding command, in this 
#               case 'rm')
#
#
#               /o)_/_/_/__/ )          --         ( \__\_\_\_(o\
#               \ ) \ \ \  \ )          --         ( /  / / / ( /
