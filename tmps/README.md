# pythonscripts/tmps
This is the main part of the repository containing different scripts with different usage or no usage at all.
I wrote the scripts to train and learn Python therefor some may be broken, useless or otherwise strange.

'''
Currently it contains the following:
- tmps/__init__.py and tmps/tmps.py: main menu (wip)
